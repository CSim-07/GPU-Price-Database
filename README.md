GPU Market Pricing Database

Overview
This initiative is a study of the past price patterns of graphics cards both in the retail and second hand market. I did it to train on extracting, cleaning, and querying messy data.

Tools Used
Kaggle, Excel, SQLite, and SQL

Process
1. Downloaded raw pricing data on Kaggle.
2. Cleaned the spreadsheet in Excel to fix the headers and unnecessary columns.
3. Converted the clean data to local SQLite database.
4. Wrote SQL query to eliminate zero values and to find the maximum, minimum and average price of each component.
